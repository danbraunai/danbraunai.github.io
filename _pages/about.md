I am a research engineer currently based in Sydney, Australia. My career goal is to help understand artificially intelligent systems, thereby reducing the risks they pose and increasing the probability of a prosperous future in their presence.

Currently, I'm working on understanding the neural mechanisms of behaviour in reinforcement learning agents ([Distill-style article](https://github.com/interpreting-rl-behavior) in progress).

In 2021, I did an Honours in Computer Science at The University of Sydney, graduating with Honours Class I and The University Medal (WAM: 92.5). [My thesis](files/thesis.pdf) was on reinforcement learning with temporal logic objectives. Previously, I worked as a research engineer at [NukkAI](https://nukk.ai), developing logic-based AI systems and software tools to make and understand decisions in the game of Bridge. Prior to that, I developed predictive models for sports, played Poker and Bridge, and earned a Bachelor's of Mathematics from The University of Wollongong, Australia.
