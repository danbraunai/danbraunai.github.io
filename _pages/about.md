I am a Computer Science (Hons) student at The University of Sydney (expected graduation Dec 2021). My career goal is to help develop and understand artificially intelligent systems: reducing the risks they pose and increasing the probability of a prosperous future in their presence. I'm currently working on:
- Effective methods for satisfying objectives (e.g. those given by Linear Temporal Logic formulae) in reinforcement learning;
- Understanding the behaviours of reinforcement learning agents through generative visualisations.

Previously, I worked as a research engineer at [NukkAI](https://nukk.ai), developing logic-based AI systems and software tools to make and understand decisions in the game of Bridge. Prior to that, I developed predictive models for sports, played Poker and Bridge, and earned a Bachelor's of Mathematics from The University of Wollongong, Australia.
