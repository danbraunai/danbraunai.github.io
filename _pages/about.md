I am a research engineer based in London, United Kingdom. My career goal is to help understand AI systems, thereby reducing the risks they pose and increasing the probability of a prosperous future in their presence.

I'm a founding member and Lead Engineer at [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/). Our
main focus is to use interpretability and model evaluations to reduce the likelihood of developing
and deploying AIs that use deception to further goals that are not aligned with the intentions of
their designers.

Summary of my past professional experience:

- Research Engineer at [Conjecture](https://www.conjecture.dev/), working mostly on Mechanistic
  Interpretability (e.g. [sparse coding](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition), [polytope lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12312)).
- Worked on understanding the neural mechanisms of behaviour in reinforcement learning agents
  ([Distill-style article](https://github.com/interpreting-rl-behavior) in progress).
- Research Engineer at [NukkAI](https://nukk.ai), developing logic-based AI systems and software tools to make and understand decisions in the game of Bridge.
- Honours in Computer Science at The University of Sydney, graduating with Honours
  Class I and The University Medal (WAM: 92.5). [My thesis](files/thesis.pdf) was on reinforcement learning with temporal logic objectives.
- Developed profitable predictive models for sports betting.
- Poker and bridge player.
- Earned a Bachelor's of Mathematics from The University of Wollongong, Australia.
