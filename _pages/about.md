I am a researcher based in London, United Kingdom. My career goal is to help understand AI systems, thereby reducing the risks they pose and increasing the probability of a prosperous future in their presence.

I'm a member of technical staff at [Goodfire](https://www.goodfire.ai/), developing and scaling
fundamental interpretability methods.

Summary of my past professional experience:

- Founding member, Lead Engineer and Head of Security at [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/). Helped bring Linear Parameter Decompositions to the
  field ([APD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14926)). Also contributed to work on [end-to-end SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12241).
- Research Engineer at [Conjecture](https://www.conjecture.dev/), working mostly on Mechanistic
  Interpretability (e.g. early work on [sparse autoencoders](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/z6QQJbtpkEAX3Aojj/interim-research-report-taking-features-out-of-superposition), [polytope lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12312)).
- Worked on understanding the neural mechanisms of behaviour in reinforcement learning agents
  ([Distill-style article](https://github.com/interpreting-rl-behavior)).
- Research Engineer at [NukkAI](https://nukk.ai), developing logic-based AI systems and software tools to make and understand decisions in the game of Bridge.
- Honours in Computer Science at The University of Sydney, graduating with Honours
  Class I and The University Medal (WAM: 92.5). [My thesis](files/thesis.pdf) was on reinforcement learning with temporal logic objectives.
- Developed profitable predictive models for sports betting.
- Poker and bridge player.
- Earned a Bachelor's of Mathematics from The University of Wollongong, Australia.
